📝 Project Description

Our project provides information to Northern Virginia Community College(NVCC) students about the safety of their school by campus. I used Beautiful Soup to scrape the NVCC crime logs for 2022, processed it with python and provided crime statistics. We also used ChatGPT API to provide a interactive chat about safety for students. My teammate used Matplotlib to provide graphs of crime data and predictions based on past crime data. We also used Google Maps API to provide a interactive map for the campus. Our data is at the bottom of our website for any student to parse through showing every crime commited in 2022 on a NVCC campus.


🪃 For the future:

- Fix ChatGPT API to give longer more in depth responses.
- Provide more crime statistics to NVCC students and add more years of data. 
- Add more functionality.
- Set up DNS.
